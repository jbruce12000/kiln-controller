I sucked at handling my Rpi gpio pins.
I got everything backward you could.
I blew up a MAX-31855 chip. POOF, UP IN SMOKE!
Don't be like me...

If you're using a breadboard with a labeled break-out board, verify
where pin one is using a multimeter.  it sounds stupid, but it will save you time.
measure the voltage between all the 3V3 pins and a GND pin
measure the voltage betwwen all the GND pins and a GND pin
measure the voltage between the 5V pins and a GND pin.
if everything measures as expected, continue.  if not, go back to the first step.

run
gpio readall
and make sure the mode for all GPIO pins you want to test have a Mode of IN
if not, set the mode for each.. 

# set BCM pin 4 as an input
gpio -g mode 4 input

# verify it got set correctly using
gpio readall

# enable pull-down resistor for pin 4 to make sure V stays
# zero when nothing is connected to the input 
gpio -g mode 4 down

watch gpio readall

connect a 3V3 pin in series to a 1k ohm resistor
connect the other end of the resistor to each gpio pin
when it is connected V should be 1
when it is disconnected V should be 0 
my breadboard uses the BCM gpio pin numbering
